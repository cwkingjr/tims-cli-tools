## TIMS Invoice

The tims_invoice tool reads a spreadsheet extracted from the master tracing spreadsheet, grabs the columns it needs, and generates an output spreadsheet with the data transformed into the format required for pasting into a specific third party's invoice submission spreadsheet.

Invoke the tool and pass it the path as to the extract spreadsheet. You'll love your life more if you don't put spaces in your file names.

```bash
tims_invoice(.exe) <your_file_path.xlsx>
```

Unix/Linux Example:

```bash
tims_invoice Z:/invoice.xlsx
```

Windows Example:

```bash
tims_invoice.exe Z:/invoice.xlsx
```

If you want to set up a Windows batch file so you can drop a path onto an icon using Windows File Explorer, you can copy the `tims_invoice.bat` file in this repo to your desktop.
